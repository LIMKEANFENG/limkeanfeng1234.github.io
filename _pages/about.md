🎵 About Me

Hi! I’m Ethan, a 13-year-old who loves exploring new things, especially anything to do with music, robots, and games.

🎹 My Hobbies & Interests

Piano Player:
I’ve been playing the piano for a while now and love learning new songs. Music helps me relax and express myself creatively.

Robotics Enthusiast:
I enjoy building and programming robots — combining creativity and technology to make cool things move and think!

Gamer at Heart:
I love playing games, especially ones that challenge my brain or let me explore new worlds.

Food Lover:
Eating good food makes me happy! I like trying different snacks and meals (especially when I’ve earned them after a long day of piano or coding).

🤖 Skills

Basic programming (robotics, maybe Python or Scratch?)

Teamwork and problem-solving

Creativity in both music and tech

🌟 Goals

I want to keep improving my piano skills, learn more about robotics and coding, and maybe one day design a robot that can play an instrument or help people in real life.
